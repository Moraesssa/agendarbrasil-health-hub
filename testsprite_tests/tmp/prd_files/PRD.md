# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Clinic Scheduling System

_This document outlines the requirements for the Clinic Scheduling System project._

## 1. Introduction

Managing patient appointments in clinics and medical offices is often a manual, time-consuming process that is prone to errors. This inefficiency can lead to scheduling conflicts, long waiting times for patients, and a high rate of no-shows, impacting both the clinic's revenue and the quality of patient care. Communication between administrative staff, doctors, and patients is often fragmented across phone calls and emails, making it difficult to manage and track.

The **Clinic Scheduling System** is a comprehensive web platform designed to solve these challenges. It provides a centralized, automated solution for managing appointments, patient information, and doctor schedules. By optimizing the scheduling process and improving communication, the platform aims to enhance operational efficiency for clinics and deliver a more seamless and satisfactory experience for patients.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a secure, reliable, and intuitive platform that simplifies and automates clinic appointment management.

### Objectives:

*   **Reduce Patient No-Shows:** Implement an automated notification system (e.g., email, SMS) to send appointment reminders to patients, aiming to decrease no-shows.
*   **Optimize Administrative Workflow:** Automate the process of scheduling, rescheduling, and canceling appointments to reduce the manual workload on administrative staff.
*   **Improve Patient Experience:** Provide patients with a user-friendly portal to view doctor availability, book appointments online, and manage their health information.
*   **Enhance Doctor Productivity:** Offer doctors a clear view of their daily schedules, easy access to patient information, and tools to manage their availability.
*   **Ensure Data Security and Integrity:** Build a system with robust security measures to protect sensitive patient data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations like LGPD/GDPR.

## 3. Target Audience and User Personas

The platform is designed to serve three primary user groups, each with distinct needs and system interactions.

### 3.1. Clinic Administrator / Receptionist

## 4. System Features

This section details the functional requirements of the Clinic Scheduling System, broken down by feature area.

### 4.1. User Authentication and Profile Management
*   **User Registration:** Patients can create a new account using an email and password. Administrators will create accounts for doctors and other staff.
*   **User Login/Logout:** All users must be able to log in securely with their credentials and log out.
*   **Password Reset:** Users should have an option to reset their password via a secure email link.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system must restrict access to features based on user roles (Administrator, Doctor, Patient). For example, only administrators can manage all schedules, while doctors can only manage their own.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can view and edit their own profile information (e.g., name, contact details).

### 4.2. Appointment Management
*   **Create Appointment:** Administrators can book a new appointment for a patient with a specific doctor, date, and time. Patients can book their own appointments.
*   **View Appointments:**
    *   Administrators can see a global calendar view of all appointments.
    *   Doctors can see a view of their own appointments.
    *   Patients can see a list of their upcoming and past appointments.
*   **Update/Reschedule Appointment:** Administrators and patients (for their own appointments) can reschedule an existing appointment to a new date/time.
*   **Cancel Appointment:** Administrators and patients (for their own appointments) can cancel an upcoming appointment. A reason for cancellation can be optionally recorded.
*   **Real-time Availability:** The system must display a doctor's availability in real-time, preventing double bookings.

### 4.3. Patient Management (Administrator/Doctor View)
*   **Patient Database:** A searchable database of all patients, including their personal information, contact details, and appointment history.
*   **Add New Patient:** Administrators can add new patients to the system.
*   **View/Edit Patient Profile:** Authorized users can view and update a patient's information.

### 4.4. Doctor & Availability Management (Administrator View)
